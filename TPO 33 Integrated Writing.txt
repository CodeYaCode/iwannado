Both the reading and listening section focus on the purpose and meaning of carved stone balls found in Scotland. From the author's point of view, weapons used in hunting or fighting, part of a primitive system of weights and measures and served a social purpose are three possible ansewers. However, the speaker refutes the author's opinion successfully.

First, if the stone balls served as weapons, they would be cracked or have pieces broken like other Neolithic weapons. But, in fact, the surfaces of the balls show little or no damage.

Secondly, although the stone balls are uniform in size, but their masses are totally different. Because they were made of different types of stone with different density. So they could not have been used as a primitive weighting system.

Thirdly, some of the stone balls are very simple and rarely been decorated. It looks too simple to symbol the status of social hierarchy. Furthermore, no stone balls are found in the tombs or graves. So it unlikely that the balls were personal possessions that marked a person's status.
